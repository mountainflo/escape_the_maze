### Game idea

The game is designed as first person shooter. The aim of the game is to go through the maze as fast as possible. Beside the normal walls the maze has sliding walls and other obstacles the player has to destroy on his way through the maze.

### Challenge and highlight of the game

The highlight of the game are the portals. The player can go through the portal and gets out at a different location in the maze. A challenge during creation of the portals was the teleporting of the projectiles.
